this is how I described it in my report : 

my project name is EduFun
which refers to (Education and Fun).
because when I started thinking about a program to do I decided that education is the most important, so thats why I decided to go with educational program for the children. and Fun because of the learning style which is playing games to learn.

my Goal with this program is to use it as a start for my future with this idea (EduFun) since I am still a sophomore and I donâ€™t have a full programming background I tried my best to present it as I hoped, but in the future I am hoping that I will see my self continuing this project and take it to another level and make it accessible for every child to learn while playing.

I started with a small idea now I have a small program and I am walking toward the huge project
